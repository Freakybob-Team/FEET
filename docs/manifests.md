# Manifests
Every extension needs a Freakifest file.
This is a special type of Manifest that we have developed to fit our needs.
# Formatting
Freakifest now contains types to support FreakyBrowse. We use FRead to read these manifests.
## Required
"MinFBVersion": "Enter the minimum FreakyBrowse version your extension supports."
